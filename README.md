# Extract Van Gogh Paintings Code Challenge - Michał Fijałkowski

## Description

I decided to face this challenge with a NodeJS project as I'm most familiar with this technology. 

This project simply serves and parses the `van-gogh-paintings.html` file and extracts needed properties of the artworks. Each artwork object is passed to the JSON object and then a file called `expected-array.json` is created and saved in the root directory. 

## Instructions

In order to run the app, perform the following commands: 
- `npm install`
- `node index.js`

Let it run and once the `Data written to file expected-array.json` prompt is dislayed, the aforementioned file is ready.
